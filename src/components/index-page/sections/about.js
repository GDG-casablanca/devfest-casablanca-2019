          <p className="p">
            DevFests are community-led, developer events hosted by GDG chapters
            around the globe focused on community building and learning about
            Googleâ€™s technologies. Each DevFest is inspired by and uniquely
            tailored to the needs of the developer community and region that
            hosts it.
          </p>
          <p className="p">
            While no two DevFests will be exactly alike, each at its core is
            powered by a shared belief that when developers come together to
            exchange ideas, amazing things can happen.
